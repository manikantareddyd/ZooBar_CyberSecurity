It can be seen that size of buffer is not checked and simply everything is copied from *buf and so on. Given sufficiently long input entire stack can be over written by input for buf.
    int http_read_line(int fd, char *buf, size_t size)
    {
        size_t i = 0;

        for (;;)
        {
            int cc = read(fd, &buf[i], 1);
            if (cc <= 0)
                break;

            if (buf[i] == '\r')
            {
                buf[i] = '\0';      /* skip */
                continue;
            }

            if (buf[i] == '\n')
            {
                buf[i] = '\0';
                return 0;
            }

            if (i >= size - 1)
            {
                buf[i] = '\0';
                return 0;
            }

            i++;
        }

        return -1;
    }

The above bug[http.c:30] allows us to overflow the buffer and reqrite crucial stuff like the file descriptor, due to which the server crashes

Insecure use of strcat. The 'name' buffer can be of length 2048. Its being concatenated with 'pn' buffer of size 1024. Buffer overflow possible.
    strcat(pn, name);
